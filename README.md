## The Scenario

We're setting up a new product that's responsible for automating charity donations across a ten- day period.
Our users can choose the total amount of money they'd like to donate over the ten day period.
They'll also get to pick how their donation gets split across those ten days. We offer two split options to choose from:

 - equal — the same amount to be donated every day, and
 - more-odd — double the amount to be donated on odd-numbered days.

If there is any money left over at the end of the ten days, you can assume this will be donated on the last day.
